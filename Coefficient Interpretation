Interpreting Categorical Features: Since features like airconditioning were not scaled, their coefficients are directly interpretable. For example, a house with air conditioning is associated with a price increase of \approx \$772,475 compared to one without, holding all other features constant.
Interpreting Scaled Features: Features like area, bathrooms, and stories were scaled, so their coefficients reflect the impact of a "scaled unit change." We can still use their magnitude to see that area is the single most important positive driver of price, followed by bathrooms and stories.
Negative Impact: An unfurnished house is associated with a price decrease of \approx \$358,115 compared to the baseline 'furnished' category.
